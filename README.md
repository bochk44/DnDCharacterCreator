# DnDCharacterCreator

Basic Groundrules:
---

* If you aren't sure if we want to commit to the edit you've made, **make a branch**
* If you want to test interactions in GitHub, just make a new file


(if you think of your own, feel free to add to the list)

## TODO:

1. Build main page (template for class, race, background, etc. selection)
2. Build sign-in/create account page
3. Build support page
4. Build character sheet page

(again, feel free to add or modify)

## How to view our html pages:

Assuming that we have uploaded it and placed the corresponding link in our index.hmtl file, go to the enviroments tab, <br> <br>
