# DnDCharacterCreator

**_[CLICK HERE FOR CURRENT BUILD](https://bochk44.github.io/DnDCharacterCreator/)_**


* If you are adding entirely new content/a new file, just throw it in the main branch
* If you aren't sure if we want to commit to edit of an existing file you've made, **branch and make a pull request**
* If you want to test interactions in GitHub, just make a new file


## TODO:

1. Build main page (template for class, race, background, etc. selection)
2. Build sign-in/create account page
3. Build support page
4. Build character sheet page

(again, feel free to add or modify)

## How to view our html pages:

Assuming that we have uploaded it and placed the corresponding link in our index.hmtl file, go to the enviroments tab, <br> <br>
![Enviroment Location Screenshot](https://github.com/bochk44/bochk44.github.io/blob/master/README_Pictures/Screenshot7.png "Enviroments Tab Location") <br> <br>
and click "View Deployment".
<br> <br>
OR

I will do my best to keep the index page updated with links to each of our HTML files. It does take time to update the page from our source files though so if if it isn't showing new features you added, try again in ~10 minutes or so. There is also a link at the top of this README now too.
